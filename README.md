# Fine-tuning LLMs on Your Private Data

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides a clear, practical, step-by-step guide to fine-tune the open-source Llama-2 large language model (LLM) on private, internal data. This enables customized solutions such as personalized chatbots and specialized question-answering systems.

## 🔍 Why Fine-tune LLMs?

Pre-trained LLMs lack specific and domain-oriented knowledge required for specialized applications. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt its general knowledge specifically to your datasets, providing accurate, personalized responses.

## 🎯 Outcomes

* Fine-tuned LLM tailored to your own data
* Efficient training process (under 14GB RAM requirement)
* Deployable personalized chatbot or assistant

## ⚙️ Key Features

* **Open-source Model**: Utilizes Llama-2-7B-chat
* **Resource-Efficient**: Implements QLoRA (4-bit quantization) and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
* **User-Friendly**: Compatible with Google Colab (free version)
* **Automated Data Formatting**: Direct training from raw text files

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Select the Right Model

* **Model**: Llama-2-7B-chat
* Enhanced with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
* Economical and resource-efficient

### 2. Prepare Your Data

* Extract text from documents or PDFs into `.txt` format
* Tokenize using `LlamaTokenizer`

  * **Tokenization**: Converts text into tokens (words, subwords, or characters) for efficient model processing

### 3. Quantize with QLoRA

* Significantly reduces memory usage

  * Non-trainable parameters (<99%) in 4-bit precision
  * Trainable parameters (>1%) in 16-bit precision
* Suitable for environments with limited resources (Google Colab, local GPUs)

### 4. Optimize Parameters with LoRA

* Low-Rank Adaptation reduces the number of trainable parameters
* Retains original pre-trained weights, updating only specific parameters
* Accelerates training and lowers computational requirements

### 5. Train Your Model

* Adjust key hyperparameters:

  * **Learning Rate**: Step size for weight updates
  * **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed per update
  * **Epochs**: Number of complete iterations through the dataset
* Iteratively fine-tune for optimal performance

### 6. Deploy Your Chatbot

* Launch your customized Llama-2 chatbot
* Generate precise responses tailored specifically to your private data

## 📌 Example Application

* Fine-tuning on the 2023 Hawaii wildfire report:

  ```
  User: "When did the Hawaii wildfires occur in 2023?"
  Bot: "The Hawaii wildfires occurred from August 8th to August 11th, 2023."
  ```

## 📋 Requirements

* Python environment
* Google Colab or compatible GPU setup
* Llama-2 Model
* Python libraries (`transformers`, `torch`, etc.)
